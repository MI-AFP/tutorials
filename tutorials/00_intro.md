# Introduction

Functional programming paradigm is one of traditional ways of programming. If you are used to the imperative or the object-oriented programming, then it might be difficult for you to change the mindset at the very beginning, but don't panic. Even if you won't switch to functional programming fully, concepts learned in this course will be useful to you - FP concepts are in other languages like Java, C/C++, Python, etc., as well! Have you ever heard about `reduce` and `filter`?

## Course format

There are 12 lectures/tutorials which contain explanations, examples and then links to the task assignments to try it on your own. We always include list of external resources for those who want or need to read more about a given topic. Used programming language for this course is a purely functional language Haskell in implementation of GHC.

It might happen that you encounter a more advanced concept or piece of code that is not yet totally clear to you. Don't worry, most probably it is covered more deeply in the following parts of the course. If you think it is a big problem, please create an issue.
